# sense-images-links-extension
A simple table modified with conditional logic to detect hyperlinks/images, user controlled by switches.

This extension is based off of the Simple Table extension, and allows for automatic detection of hyperlinks/images. The conditional logic currently looks for cell values with 'http'/'https' or 'www' for hyperlinks, and searches for 'img.', '.jpg', '.gif', and '.png' for image detection. Detection is controlled by switches, which allows the user to decide if they would like to show links, images, or neither. There is also an option for the user to change the size of the images as well.

The intended purpose of this extension is to show how quickly and easy it is to modify an extension for your needs. This is by no means bulletproof, and it is not intended for production.
